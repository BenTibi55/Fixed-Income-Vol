# Fixed-Income-Vol
This project explores how volatility is used in fixed income markets, with a focus on its impact on swaption pricing. Using synthetic yield data and Blackâ€™s model, the project simulates both realized volatility and implied volatility surfaces, then prices swaptions across different strike and forward rate combinations.
